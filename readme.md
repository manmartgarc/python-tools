# Python Tools

Random python tools I have used more than once, and like zealous DRY fanatic I put into a repo. Most of these were made before I realized that much like `itertools`, largely _everything_ has been implemented already.

## Inventory

- `geocode_googlemaps.py`
  - A low-budget implementation of [censusgeocode](https://github.com/fitnr/censusgeocode)
- `haversinde_dist.py`
  - A low-budget implementation of [`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.haversine_distances](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.haversine_distances.html)
- `tsp_solver.py`
  - A simple heuristic based implementation to a TSP problem. Used to create surveying routes in the field for field experiments.
